# 🐝 YieldHive – Tokenize Real Estate Yield with RWA on Pharos Chain

Ever wondered how you could earn rental income from real estate without buying an entire building? 🏢

Or wished your property could earn you more by inviting global micro-investors? 🌐💸

Well... YieldHive 🐝 has got you covered!

YieldHive is a Web3 RWA (Real World Asset) platform built on the Pharos Chain that lets property owners tokenize their rental income and investors earn real yield by owning fractional property shares — all powered by our native YHT token.

## 🚀 Why Pharos?

Pharos Chain offers lightning-fast transaction throughput and low fees — ideal for YieldHive, which expects high-frequency micro transactions (share purchases, yield claims, income deposits).

Its high TPS (transactions per second) architecture ensures smooth scalability and an efficient experience for both property owners and investors.
